# trial-by-trolley
This is going to be a recreation of the board game Trial by Trolley game by Cyanide and Happiness. The goal is to give a better visual representation of the godly task at hand: choosing who shall live and who shall be given death by trolley.  
  
Backstory:  
While out at a bar with my parents last night, they described this new board game they had just bought. The board game was Trial by Trolley, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, they did not bring the game with them so we were stuck talking about an amiazing game we couldn't play. Hopefully by the time this is done I'll have made a portable version of the game I can just pull out on my phone to play with friends or family on the go. Also I think it would be cool to see a trolley approach victims on a screen compared to a static board with nothing but imagination to fuel the fire.
